👋 About Me
I’m a passionate software engineer and student driven by curiosity and the desire to create impactful digital experiences. With hands-on experience in iOS development using SwiftUI and SwiftData, I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-focused apps. My background in C programming and solid understanding of object-oriented design give me a strong technical foundation. I thrive on learning, iterating, and pushing myself to grow with every project I tackle.

I believe great software is built through cycles of improvement. Whether writing elegant code or learning something new, my motto stays the same:
Code. Learn. Improve. Repeat.
